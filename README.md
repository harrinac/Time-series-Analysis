# Time-series-Analysis
Time Series Visualization and Predictions Workflow
There are 2 notebooks in this series.

Visualizing_Time_Series_Data_1 shows methds for visualizing time series data, for decmposing into trend and seasonality components and for testing for non-stationarity. Finally some methods for transforming a non-stationary series are shown.

Time Series Forecasting-Methods_2 

Part 2 of a 2 part series. Part 1 showcased how to visualize and decomose time series data. Using a real-world anonymised dataset from e-commerce retailers, this notebook provides a comparison of time-series sales forecasting methods. I have cleaned this data and sorted in in chronolgical decreasing order in offline steps. The general approach will be to train the modesl on a subset of the sales data history and have them predict 6 months of the future time steps - sales in this case. The predicted data will then be graphed against the real data to show accuracy.

Throughout this notebook I also use a dummy dataset to illustrate some concepts. The first notebok in this series should be reviewed prior to this notebook.
